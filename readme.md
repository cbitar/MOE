##Approach to Project
    This application was built with the intentions of creating an online platform 
    with which students and teachers could connect and give and receive online lessons
    through Google Hangout's technology. I attempted to maintain organization by keeping
    the AngularJS portion of the application within the public folder of the app. The 
    Express portion of the app is outside that public client-side folder. This project 
    still requires alot of development, but it is the basis of an app that would more 
    easily connect students and teachers of music online.
